# Check if the argument is provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <filename.c>"
    exit 1

# Extract the filename without extension
filename=$(basename "$1" .c)

# Compile the C file
gcc "$1" -o "$filename"

# Check if compilation was successful

Save this script in a file (let's say `compile_and_run.sh`), make it executable with the command `chmod +x compile_and_run.sh`, and then you can run it with the `.c` file as an argument:

```bash
./compile_and_run.sh yourfile.c
```

Replace `yourfile.c` with the actual name of the C file you want to compile and execute. Make sure the script and the `.c` file are in the same directory.
